# GummyBearArenaRPG
  Final project for one of my programming courses. I made a text-based RPG where the player is a gummy bear that must defeat the Seven Deadly Bears (seven levels). The player begins with default stats (attack, defense, speed) and must train their bear in order to defeat future levels. 
  I created a heads-up display to display the player and enemy's stats that updates during battle. I utilized inheritance while creating the player and enemy classes. I created additional classes to hold information about actions the player or enemy bear could perform, combat class for attacking or defending, training class, game utilities class for the display menu/game stats. I established a file save system to allow player to save their game progress whenever they choose. The information is written into a .txt file. The player can load their game progress by their name. 
  This project was really fun. Although it was for school, it was the first time I have ever experimented with coding games, even if it was a text-based one. My favorite part was creating the HUD because it gave more of a game-like feel, but I do wish I had more time to add a plot with boss descriptions. I definitely want to explore more with this project, perhaps through visuals!
